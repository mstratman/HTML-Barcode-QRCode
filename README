NAME
    HTML::Barcode::QRCode - Generate HTML representations of QR codes

SYNOPSIS
    Text::QRCode and libqrencode are required by this class, so please
    install them first.

      my $code = HTML::Barcode::QRCode->new(text => 'http://search.cpan.org');
      print $code->render;

DESCRIPTION
    This class allows you to easily create HTML representations of QR codes.
    These are two-dimensional scan codes commonly used to allow people to
    quickly input a URL into their phone or other mobile device.

    This requires Text::QRCode.

    You can read more about QR codes online (e.g.
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code).

METHODS
  new (%attributes)

    Instantiate a new HTML::Barcode::QRCode object. The `%attributes' hash
    requires the text attribute, and can take any of the other attributes
    listed below.

  render

    This is a convenience routine which returns `<style>...</style>' tags
    and the rendered QR code.

    If you are printing multiple QR codes or want to ensure your `style'
    tags are in your HTML headers, then you probably want to output the QR
    code and style separately with the render_barcode and css entries
    elsewhere in this document.

  render_barcode

    Returns only the rendered QR code. You will need to provide stylesheets
    separately, either writing them yourself or using the output of css.

  css

    Returns CSS needed to properly display your rendered QR code. This is
    only necessary if you are using render_barcode instead of the easier
    render method.

ATTRIBUTES
    These attributes can be passed to new, or used as accessors.

  text

    Required - The information to put into the QR code.

  foreground_color

    A CSS color value (e.g. '#000' or 'black') for the foreground. Default
    is '#000'.

  background_color

    A CSS color value background. Default is '#fff'.

  module_size

    A CSS value for the width and height of an individual module (a dot) in
    the code. Default is '3px'.

  css_class

    The value for the `class' attribute applied to any container tags in the
    HTML (e.g. `table' or `div'). `td' tags within the table will have
    either css_class_on or css_class_off classes applied to them.

    For example, if css_class is "barcode", you will get `<table
    class="barcode">' and its cells will be either `<td class="barcode_on">'
    or `<td class="barcode_off">'.

  embed_style

    Rather than rendering CSS stylesheets, embed the style information in
    HTML `style' attributes. You should not use this option without good
    reason, as it greatly increases the size of the generated markup, and
    makes it impossible to override with stylesheets.
